    "Access to loans is a huge problem for many people in the world. To combat this problem, Kiva, an international nonprofit, connects people with lenders in an attempt to alleviate poverty. There are over 2.5 million borrowers in 84 countries involved with Kiva. With a 97.1 repayment rate, the 1.6 million lenders have lent over 1 billion dollars. As Kiva is a nonprofit, it has developers worldwide and has shared its data. The Kiva API (application programming interface, a concept we will cover later in this course) has many files and formats containing the information of loans, partners, temas, and more. For the purpose of this project, we will focus on the xml files. The xml files, containing data from June 27, 2017, are included in the `data` directory associated with this project. "

    "   To be a lender for Kiva you would check Kiva for opportunities and select one you wish to loan money to. Then you crowdfund the loan in increments of $25 or more. Once you complete the fundraising the borrower will eventually repay the loan and lenders can then use repayments to fund new loans, donate or withdraw their money. Once you select a borrower to lend to and raise the money needed Kiva takes care of the rest by using due diligence and monitoring processes. While Kiva does not guarantee repayment on any loans they do a great job of educating lenders about the risks.
