# KivaProject
This was a project done for the CS181 class at Denison University. It focuses on analyzing data from the non-profit organization Kiva. A variety of techniques were used to retrieve and analyze data.

The project was meant to look at Kiva's data and analyze data regarding their partners and loans. To completely replicate this project many different methods and programs must be used. Xml, python, pandas, SQL, and Tableau were all used to complete this project. Combining all of these in a Jupyter Notebook makes it easy to have all of these things in one place. 

All of the data comes from Kiva's API. Their API's have many files and formats containing the information of loans, partners, teams, and more. This project specifically used the xml files. These xml files contain data from June 27, 2017 and are located in the data folder of this repository. Kiva is a nonprofit organization so it has many developers worldwide and openly shares its data.

Kiva's Code of Conduct: http://build.kiva.org/docs/code_of_conduct
After carefully reading Kiva's code of conduct I believe that I have not violated any of their requests through this project. The project was just used in an acedemic setting and none of the data or results were used for commercial purposes. 

Dr. Thomas Bressoud created the project. Graphs and description of the code were written and created by myself, Lauren Hawley.
